# DOCUMENTATION

- Once you have cloned the document, open it up in your code editor.
- After opening the file in your code editor, access the terminal either on your PC or within your code editor.
- Run 'node server.js' in the terminal. Or (optional) install nodemon via NPM so that you do not have to keep running 'node server.js' everytime a change is made in the code.
- Was 'node server.js' has been run in your terminal, open up your default browser and type in 'http://localhost:8080/log-in' into the search bar in order to access the application.
- Once you have typed in the above local host address, you will be presented with a sign in page - input any name and email address, click the sign in button and you will be in the chatroom.
- In order to initialise a chat, open up another window with the same local host mentioined above and sign in again. Type any message in the message input area, click send, and witness the incomming messages on both tabs simultaneously!
